- Clean up files and use the suffixes instead of flat name + exclusion (if there's already a .?)
- Add callbacks method to plugins
- raw pipe and filter mode (only output found items with no prefix or suffix)

The simple crawler option (not likely to happen)
- vhost discovery
- php include error parser
