Tachyon is a Fast Multi-Threaded Web Discovery Tool.

The main goal of tachyon is to help webadmins find leftover files in their
site installation, permission problems and web server configuration errors.

It is not a vulnerability scanner, or a web crawler.

It provides:
 - Plugin support
 - SSL support
 - Robots.txt support
 - Common directory lookup
 - Fast Multi-Threaded execution
 - Automatic variable rate limiter
 - Recursive scanning

REQUIREMENTS    
- A mainstream OS (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X)
- Python 2.7
- urllib3 1.1+ (~# easy_install urllib3) 

HOW TO HELP (for sysadmins)
- Run tachyon on your domain
- Run a recursive directory listing of your domain (I don't need to know what is the domain)
- Send me the result list and the directory listing

Known bugs:
- String matching is not working properly for now, response data is somewhat truncated. File will still be reported but without content matching validation.

Todo for 2.0.0
- in progress: Improved timeout algorithm
- in progress: New stats string

Possible future improvements:
- Put back TOR support.
- Parseable output for GUI integration (better stats system for live stats)
- Add an match-string=404 mechanism for edge cases
- Add callbacks method to plugins
- Support files in robots plugin
- Add support for non-xml /.svn/entries files
- Sitemap.xml plugin
