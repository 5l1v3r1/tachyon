Tachyon is a Fast Multi-Threaded Web Discovery Tool.

The main goal of tachyon is to help webadmins find leftover files in their
site installation, permission problems and web server configuration errors.

It is not a vulnerability scanner, or a web crawler.

It provides:
 - Plugin support
 - SSL support
 - Tor support (trough privoxy)
 - Robots.txt support
 - Common directory lookup
 - Fast Multi-Threaded execution



TODO:
- Fix speedtester plugin
- Add callbacks method to plugins
- raw pipe and filter mode (only output found items with no prefix or suffix)


Using tor
- Under Ubuntu:
	- sudo apt-get install tor, privoxy
	- open /etc/privoxy/conf, go to section 5.2, uncomment the line concerning Tor on localhost
	- sudo service privoxy restart
- Enable the tor switch in tachyon 
- Be patient, it will be a lot slower.
