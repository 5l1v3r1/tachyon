Tachyon is a Fast Multi-Threaded Web Discovery Tool.

The main goal of tachyon is to help webadmins find leftover files in their
site installation, permission problems and web server configuration errors.

It is not a vulnerability scanner, or a web crawler.

It provides:
 - Plugin support
 - SSL support
 - Tor support (trough privoxy)
 - Robots.txt support
 - Common directory lookup
 - Fast Multi-Threaded execution



TODO:
- Add support for status, using spacebar
- Fix speedtester plugin
- Add Tor support
- Add callbacks method to plugins
- raw pipe and filter mode (only output found items with no prefix or suffix)
- Fix ctrl+c abort during file searching phase (complex. queue.join() blocks)
