Tachyon is a Fast Multi-Threaded Web Discovery Tool.

The main goal of tachyon is to help webadmins find leftover files in their
site installation, permission problems and web server configuration errors.

It is not a vulnerability scanner, or a web crawler.

It provides:
 - Plugin support
 - SSL support
 - Tor support (trough privoxy)
 - Robots.txt support
 - Common directory lookup
 - Fast Multi-Threaded execution

HOW TO HELP (for sysadmins)
- Run tachyon on your domain
- Run a recursive directory listing of your domain (I don't need to know what is the domain)
- Send me the result list and the directory listing

TODO:
- Fix speedtester plugin (or remove it)
- Add callbacks method to plugins
- Support files in robots plugin
- Do not scan readable directories (index of), just report them.
- Add an match-string=404 mechanism for edge cases
- Interractive mode, to remove and add stuff at some points
- Variable automatic speed limiter (optional)
- If code is 500, match "Forbidden", since it's a common redirect scenario

Using tor
- Under Ubuntu:
	- sudo apt-get install tor, privoxy
	- open /etc/privoxy/conf, go to section 5.2, uncomment the line concerning Tor on localhost
	- sudo service privoxy restart
- Enable the tor switch in tachyon 
- Be patient, it will be a lot slower.
