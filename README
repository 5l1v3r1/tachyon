Tachyon is a Fast Multi-Threaded Web Discovery Tool.

The main goal of tachyon is to help webadmins find leftover files in their
site installation, permission problems and web server configuration errors.

It provides:
 - Plugin support
 - SSL support
 - Tor support (trough privoxy)
 - Robots.txt support
 - Common directory lookup
 - Fast Multi-Threaded execution



TODO:
- Exclude 403 directories from "FOUND" result but not from further testing
- Tweak 404/redirect detection algorithm
- Add Tor support
- Add callbacks method to plugins
- Add optional rate-limiter to slow down scan if there's too many timeout in a given time
- raw pipe and filter mode (only output found items with no prefix or suffix)
- The simple crawler option (not likely to happen)
    - vhost discovery
    - php include error parser
